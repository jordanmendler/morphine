# “Regulated distraction” for more productivity

## About

Morphine is a website blocker with a twist. It aims to reduce distraction and increase productivity. Unlike other website blockers though, nstead of allotting a certain amount of time each day for using blocked sites, Morphine gives you a "balance" to pull from, which is very slowly filled with minutes. The more you work, the more you get to play! This allows you to use your blocked sites whenever you want for as long as you want—provided you have enough time in your balance. In other words: Regulated Distraction™®!

But why take this approach? Well, let's say you're at work and have a standard website blocker turned on. A friend sends you a link to an item on one of your blocked sites, but when you try to access it, turns out you've already used all your daily allotted time up! You get pissed off and disable the plugin to "cheat" and never turn it back on. With Morphine, your wait would be no more than 10 minutes (by default), since the balance is always slowly being added to based on your desired work-life balance.
